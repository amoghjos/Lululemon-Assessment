### Build two screens as shown above.

- The first screen shows a list of garment names and buttons to order the list by alphabetical order or by creation date/time.
- A “+” button at the top right corner presents the second screen as a modal view.
- The second screen allows saving a new garment in persistent memory, using the database of your choice. Tapping the “Save” button closes the modal view and returns to the first screen with the list. The list then shows the newly added garment.
